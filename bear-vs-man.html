    <h1>Would You Rather: Man or Bear?</h1>
    <p>This question — "Would you rather be stuck in the woods with a man or a bear?" — exploded online like wildfire. The answers were polarizing, emotional, and oddly revealing.</p>

    <p>Most men chose a man. Most women… chose the bear.</p>

    <p>Not because it’s safer — but because, as many bluntly said, “At least I know where the bear stands.”</p>

    <h2>That’s Not Just Sad. That’s a Warning.</h2>
    <p>We've reached a point where wild predators are seen as more trustworthy than men. Not because bears have changed. But because the narrative around men has.</p>

    <p>Men are no longer assumed to be protectors. They're viewed as threats, jokes, or enemies. And sure — some deserve that. But *all* of us?</p>

    <p>That’s where the problem starts.</p>

    <h2>The Bear</h2>
    <p>It might maul you. It might walk away. But it doesn’t manipulate. It doesn’t play pretend. A bear is dangerous, but honest.</p>

    <h2>The Man</h2>
    <p>He might light a fire and share his coat — or he might be the reason you need to run. That ambiguity? That’s the fear. But also, that’s the potential.</p>

    <p>Because in a real survival scenario, **a good man is your best chance** — not your biggest threat.</p>

    <h2>This Isn’t a Joke. It’s a Cry for Trust.</h2>
    <p>We’ve failed each other. Men weren’t taught how to feel. Women weren’t taught how to discern strength from control. We call masculinity “toxic,” then cry out for men to lead again.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, men stay silent. They internalize. They retreat. And the world grows colder. Both sides are hurting. Both sides are over it. But **if a bear attacks you**, hashtags won't save you. A good man will.</p>

    <h2>Be Real: You’d Rather Have the Man (If He Was a Good One)</h2>
    <p>Stop pretending 40 random bears is safer than 40 men. That’s emotional spite, not logic. Bears don’t build shelters. Men do. Bears don’t hand you clean water. Men do.</p>

    <p>You don’t have to trust every man. But stop pretending there aren’t millions of us out here trying to get it right.</p>

    <p>And for the record — men, quit being soft and outraged. Be better. Be stronger. Be useful. Lead with calm, not ego. We don’t need applause. We need to step the hell up.</p>

    <h2>If You Still Choose the Bear…</h2>
    <p>That’s your right. But if things get ugly out there, you’ll want more than a can of hairspray and a podcast full of talking points. You’ll want this:</p>

    <h2>Let’s End With a Truce</h2>
    <p>We’re not enemies. We're wounded animals. But only one of us is willing to admit we’re still learning.</p>

    <p>Some men are monsters. But many are tired, good-hearted, broken protectors who’ve been taught to shut up and keep walking. And some women are bitter. But many are scared, jaded, and just want to feel safe again.</p>

    <p>Here’s to the real ones — the men who build, and the women who still believe.</p>

      Dedicated to my mother, Shirley Serpico — who taught me that a real man protects with strength, listens with softness, and understands that loving women is not weakness — it's legacy.
