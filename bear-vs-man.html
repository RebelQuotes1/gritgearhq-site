    <h1>Would You Rather: Man or Bear?</h1>
    <p>Would you rather be dropped into deep woods with a random man — or a random bear?</p>
    <p>On the surface, it seems like a silly hypothetical. But we’ve all seen the online responses. Women overwhelmingly pick the bear. And not because they think it’s safer. But because of how deeply they distrust men.</p>

    <h2>The Bear</h2>
    <p>A bear is terrifying. It can maul, chase, kill. But it’s not malicious. It doesn’t hate you. It’s just being what it is. You can read a bear. Avoid it. Outwit it. Scare it. It might ignore you. It might run. It might rip your arms off.</p>

    <h2>The Man</h2>
    <p>A man, on the other hand, could be anything. He could help you. Save you. Or stalk you. He might be a predator. A sadist. A murderer. Or he might build a fire, purify water, and stand watch while you sleep. There’s uncertainty — and power — in that.</p>

    <h2>Let’s Go Deeper</h2>
    <p>Pat a bear on the head, and you might lose an arm. Pat a man on the head, and… well, it depends on the man.</p>
    <p>But ask yourself this: Would you rather be lost with 40 random bears… or 40 random men?</p>
    <p>If you said “bears,” logic says you’re delusional. Or petty. Or both.</p>
    <p>Because statistically, you’re more likely to survive with 40 men. Some will fight. Some will lead. Some will know bushcraft. Some will hunt. Some will fail. But collectively, it’s civilization. Bears don’t cooperate. Bears don’t make fire. Bears don’t build shelter.</p>

    <h2>The Real Reason You Chose the Bear</h2>
    <p>Let’s be real — it’s not about safety. It’s a social signal. It’s just another petty jab at men. One more reason to trash talk. It’s not new. It’s not profound. It’s just predictable.</p>

    <p>You’d do the same in any other hypothetical.</p>

    <p>And that’s fine. We get it. You don’t like men. But here’s the truth: It says more about you than it does about us.</p>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Maybe the question was never about men vs. bears.<br>
    Maybe it’s about how far we’ve drifted from each other… how quick we are to assume the worst instead of hoping for the best.</p>

    <p>The man might be a threat. So might the bear. But the man might also be the one who gives you water, builds your fire, and watches your back through the night.</p>

    <p>And if it were you, the man, and the bear… who would you side with?</p>

    <p><strong>Let that sink in.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Men</strong>, if you had to talk about your feelings — would you feel safer opening up to a woman… or a tree?</p>

    <p>And if either the man or the bear comes for you…<br>

    <h2>Together We're Better</h2>
    <p>We’re not enemies — we’re survivors. Different strengths, different fears, but one shared truth:<br>
    <strong>We are better together. And together, we’re better.</strong></p>
