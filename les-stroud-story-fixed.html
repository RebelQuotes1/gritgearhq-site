  <h1>Grit in the Cold: My Les Stroud Moment</h1>

  <p>At 21, I first saw “<strong>Survivorman</strong>.” Les Stroud came on screen—calm, deliberate, alone in the wild—and something inside me lit up. It wasn’t inspiration. It was a challenge. I thought, “If he can do it, so can I.”</p>

  <p>So, naturally, I packed up the dumbest assortment of camping gear imaginable—gimmicky gadgets, canned food, an unrated sleeping bag—and trudged off alone into the snowy woods. The temperature was somewhere south of 20 below. I didn’t check. I was too busy romanticizing the misery.</p>

  <p>I had on blue jeans. Not snow pants. Not thermal layers. And steel-toe boots that would later try to claim a few of my toes. My brilliant plan also included bringing along a small bottle of alcohol. I figured it’d help me sleep or maybe boost morale.</p>

  <p>What it did instead was drop my body temperature even lower while giving me the illusion that I wasn’t a first-class nickel rookie. By the time I started hiking again, I was already borderline hypothermic and convinced I was the next Les Stroud. Only problem? He didn’t film his show drunk, freezing, and hallucinating under a pine tree.</p>
