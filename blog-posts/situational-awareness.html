  <p>Brooklyn, 4 AM. A couple steps off the MTA bus and finds a quiet bench to talk. But peace is an illusion in a predatorâ€™s playground.</p>
  <p>The man spotted trouble before it struck. A guy walks by slow, eyes locked. Says something off. He keeps walking... but you know that type. Heâ€™s not done. A few minutes later, he circles back. This time he squares up. No words. Just a flash. The blade is out. By the time help comes, the victim is bleeding out. Too late.</p>
  <p>This isnâ€™t fiction. The man died. His only mistake was ignoring the red flags. Situational awareness isnâ€™t paranoiaâ€”itâ€™s survival instinct. Donâ€™t silence it.</p>
