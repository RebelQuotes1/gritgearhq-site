  <h1>I Should Be Dead. Instead, I Sell Grit.</h1>
  <p><em>How I survived gangs, liver failure, and the slow death of the modern man.</em></p>

  <p>I should be dead.</p>
  <p>That’s not an exaggeration. It’s not a marketing hook. It’s a fact.</p>
  <p>I’ve had a shotgun in my hands and murder in my heart. I’ve been tortured, jumped, left bleeding in the street. I’ve outlived gang wars, addiction, jail cells, and liver failure.</p>
  <p>I’ve seen death. I’ve walked with him. And I told him, <strong>“Not yet.”</strong></p>

  <h2>⛓️ Arkansas → Chicago → Warzone</h2>
  <p>I was born in the Delta, raised wild along the St. Francis River. I played in muddy water and fought in schoolyards. By 12, I was in too deep, Arkansas schools were ready to ship me off to juvie. So my dad sent me to Chicago.</p>
  <p>I didn’t find peace there. I found a different battlefield.</p>
  <p>I joined a gang because I didn’t see another option. It was survival. I took beatings. I gave worse. I earned rank, earned scars, earned enemies. I was kidnapped once. I was supposed to die. They let me live.</p>

  <h2>💀 The Slow Suicide of Addiction</h2>
  <p>I spent my 20s like I was invincible. Booze, chaos, violence, parties, lockups. I had a son at 19 but barely held on to the title of “father.”</p>
  <p>Eventually, I woke up yellow, bloated, and half-dead. Stage 4 liver failure. No money. No will. Just a daughter too young to understand, and a wife who deserved better.</p>
  <p>I prayed, not for a miracle, but for time. Time to be the man I never saw growing up. Time to be the father she could remember fondly and proudly.</p>

  <h2>🛠️ Rebuild from the Dirt</h2>
  <p>Against every odd, I survived. I quit drinking. I got strong. I started writing books. Started building a life.</p>
  <p>I didn’t want therapy-speak or feel-good slogans. I wanted truth. Grit. Something raw enough to punch through the noise.</p>
  <p>So I built <a href="https://gritgearhq.com" target="_blank"><strong>Grit Gear HQ</strong></a>, not just a brand, but a warning.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>If you’re soft, stay home.<br>But if you know life has teeth, welcome.</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>🔥 This Is the Grit Era</h2>
  <p>The world’s gotten fragile. Weak men cry online while real life falls apart.</p>
  <p>I’m not here to motivate you. I’m here to remind you: <strong>pain is coming.</strong></p>
  <p>Whether it’s economic collapse, violence, or the demons in your own bloodstream, something’s going to try to take you out.</p>
  <p>You better have something sharp in your hand and fire in your chest when it does.</p>

  <h2>🚪 Want In?</h2>
  <p>You don’t need to join anything. Just survive. Learn. Prepare. Protect your own.</p>
