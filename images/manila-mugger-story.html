      <h1>Surviving the Manila Mugger</h1>
      <p>
        Manila’s got this energy—chaotic, beautiful, dangerous. I was in my early 20s, green behind the ears,
        tagging along with my girlfriend at the time. We were drinking at a dive bar tucked in one of the rougher
        alleys near the port. She wandered off to mess with the jukebox, and that’s when they snatched her purse.
        A little gang of local pool sharks. They did it slick, too—like it wasn’t their first rodeo.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t make a scene right away. I stood up slow, walked over. Calm but direct. Called them out.
        It got tense fast. Chairs scraping. Voices raising. But someone stepped in, de-escalated just enough to keep it
        from turning bloody. Still, my adrenaline was screaming. I took a few shots to steady the nerves. Mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        The liquor dulled my edge. Made me sloppy. I went alone into the back bathroom—should’ve known better.
        I was on edge, locked in, knowing I might have to do something ugly. Sure enough, three of them followed me in.
        One of them sized me up, then turned around and muttered, “I ain’t trying to get cut.”
        That left two. One just stared at me. Not scared. Not angry. Just... cold. Like he was weighing whether I was
        worth the effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        What they didn’t know was I was ready to gut the first one who twitched wrong. My hand was in my pocket, wrapped
        tight around the small folding blade I always carried. I had no backup, no exit plan, just the raw animal instinct
        to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe they saw it in my eyes, maybe it was dumb luck—but they left. Slowly. Like they were bored. Like it was a game.
        I stood there alone for a long time, heart punching my ribs like a speed bag.
      </p>
      <p>
        That night taught me a lot. About people. About danger. And about the edge we all walk when we’re in someone else’s city,
        someone else’s game. If you’re gonna travel, gear up, wise up, and don’t let your ego write checks your luck can’t cash.
