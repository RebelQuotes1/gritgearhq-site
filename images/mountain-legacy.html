    <h1>Legacy on the Edge: Climbing Past the Fear</h1>
    <p>
      I was there visiting a friend who had just started a medical weed grow—back before recreational weed was even legal in Colorado. 
      He was fearless, a mountain goat in human form, and he took me straight into his favorite climbs like I had the experience to match. 
      Truth is, I had flown in from Danville, Illinois, with a bad case of sciatic pain, chain-smoking and drinking like it was an Olympic sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      That first climb at Garden of the Gods nearly ended me. One bad step and I slipped toward a deadly drop. 
      I saved myself using my dad’s brand-new camera—ironically the one thing he told me not to bring. 
      I jammed it into the rock like a climbing pick, and it gave me just enough resistance to claw my way back from the edge. 
      My buddy told me to mirror his every move after that. And I did. All the way to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      I conquered three mountains on that trip. Camped in a cave whispered about by quiet men. Sat under the stars with a .22LR plinker, a flask of whiskey, 
      and a question in my heart: was I the first man in centuries to rest here and feel this alive?
    </p>
