      <h1>When Violence Is the Answer</h1>
      <p>One night wasn’t even particularly bad because everyone came out unscathed — but it stands out in my memory as a lesson on complacency. Because I could’ve lost a lot more than my girl’s purse.</p>

      <p>I was young and drinking at a dive bar on the bad side of town with my girlfriend and a few buddies. She made the mistake of leaving her purse unattended. A few minutes later, it vanished. Only one group had been near it — some Chicago gang members who were posted up around the pool table.</p>

      <p>What started as chest-thumping and tense glares simmered just enough to avoid an all-out brawl. I returned to the bar and knocked back more than a few shots — enough to be stupid, numb, and just complacent enough to go poking around alone. I had the bright idea to check the bathroom trash for her purse, figuring maybe they took the cash and ditched the rest. At the very least, I could recover her driver’s license and green card.</p>

      <p>But as soon as I walked in, three of them followed. One locked the door behind them.</p>

      <p>Instinct kicked in. I slipped my switchblade out but kept it low and closed. My dad’s words echoed: “Never pull a weapon unless you’re ready to use it.” So I stood calm — finger on the release — eyes locked with theirs. There wasn’t fear in me, but there was tension, and they felt it too. A stalemate. One of them bailed. Then the second. The third stood still, eyes scanning me for weakness. “What you got a knife for, then?” he asked. I answered, “It ain’t open... yet.”</p>

      <p>And that was it. After a long pause, he left. I walked out without a scratch. Nobody got stabbed — but they were closer than they’ll ever know. And me? I almost learned that hesitation isn't the same as fear. It was just waiting for the moment I had no other choice. That’s not cowardice — that’s control.</p>

      <p>The same bar shut down not long after. A man was stabbed to death there just a few nights later. Someone else got run over in the lot. The owner had hired gang members as security — thugs for hire. It was a warzone disguised as nightlife. I got lucky that night. Not because I fought — but because I didn’t have to.</p>
