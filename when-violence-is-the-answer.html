      <h1>When Violence Is the Answer</h1>

      <p>It was just a regular dive bar night in my early 20s. I was there with my girlfriend. She had zero situational awareness because she figured I'll protect her and she left her purse unattended on one of the tables. In fairness she only had her back to it for just a minute to mess with the jukebox, and when she looked back ‚Äî her purse was gone.</p>

      <p>I knew exactly who did it. Group of gangbangers near the pool table, watching everything. I walked up calm and called it out. Things got heated real quick ‚Äî some pushing, raised voices, tension in the air thick enough to cut. It didn‚Äôt explode, but it damn near did.</p>

      <p>After it calmed down, I sat back down and took a couple shots. Not the smartest move. The liquor didn‚Äôt help ‚Äî it just dulled my edge. I got complacent.</p>

      <p>Then I went into the bathroom alone to search the trash can for my braindead girl's purse.</p>

      <p>Three guys followed me in.</p>

      <p>One of them took one look at me, shook his head and said, ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt tryin‚Äô to get cut,‚Äù and dipped. He could feel what was about to happen.</p>

      <p>The other two stayed.</p>

      <p>One of them just stood there, sizing me up. Quiet. No smile. No bluffing. Eyes preditory like a cat about to pounce but more cold and sinister. I said "I don't want any trouble, im just looking for something." "Whatchu got a knife foe if you don't want no problems?" he replied. "It aint open...yet" I said in a low, steady voice. Never breaking eye contact. He wanted to hurt me ‚Äî I could feel it in the way he looked at me. But he didn‚Äôt move though. Just stared.</p>

      <p>I stood there calm, switchblade in my right hand down to my side, unopened with my finger on the trigger button ready to rock. Ready to gut the first one foolish enough to make a move. But it never happened. After a few minutes that seemed like eternity, they both walked out.</p>

      <p>Later I figured they probably took the cash and ditched the purse. I went outside and checked trash cans hoping to at least find her ID and green card. No luck.</p>

      <p>That night could‚Äôve gone real bad. But it didn‚Äôt. And maybe that‚Äôs what makes it stand out more. It reminded me how fast things can spiral ‚Äî how one bad move, one wrong look, one twitch could‚Äôve changed everything.</p>

      <p>Lesson? Never confuse silence for safety. Don't leave your shit unattended in a shady place. And don‚Äôt ever let a few drinks make you forget where you are. In fact, maybe the lesson was that I shouldn't have been there in the first place.</p>

      <p>The same bar shut down not long after. A man was stabbed to death there just a few nights later. Someone else got run over in the lot. The owner had hired gang members as security ‚Äî thugs for hire. It was a warzone disguised as nightlife. I got lucky that night. Not because I fought ‚Äî but because I didn‚Äôt have to.</p>
