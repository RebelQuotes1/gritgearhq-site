      <h1>When Violence Is the Answer</h1>
      <p.It was just a regular dive bar night in my early 20s. I was there with my girlfriend. She turned her back for a second to mess with the jukebox, and when she looked back — her purse was gone.

I knew exactly who did it. Group of gangbangers near the pool table, watching everything. I walked up calm and called it out. Things got heated real quick — some pushing, raised voices, tension in the air thick enough to cut. It didn’t explode, but it damn near did.

After it calmed down, I sat back down and took a couple shots. Not the smartest move. The liquor didn’t help — it just dulled my edge. I got complacent.

Then I went into the bathroom alone.

Three guys followed me in.

One of them took one look at me, shook his head and said, “I ain’t tryin’ to get cut,” and dipped. He could feel what was about to happen.

The other two stayed.

One of them just stood there, sizing me up. Quiet. No smile. No bluffing. He wanted to hurt me — I could feel it in the way he looked at me. He didn’t move though. Just stared.

I stood there calm, blade in my pocket, ready to gut the first one who made a move. But nothing happened. After a few minutes, they both walked out.

Later I figured they probably took the cash and ditched the purse. I went outside and checked trash cans hoping to at least find her ID and green card. No luck.

That night could’ve gone real bad. But it didn’t. And maybe that’s what makes it stand out more. It reminded me how fast things can spiral — how one bad move, one wrong look, one twitch could’ve changed everything.

Lesson? Never confuse silence for safety. Don't leave your shit unattended in a shady place. And don’t ever let a few drinks make you forget where you are. In fact, maybe the lesson was that I shouldn't have been there in the first place.

      <p>The same bar shut down not long after. A man was stabbed to death there just a few nights later. Someone else got run over in the lot. The owner had hired gang members as security — thugs for hire. It was a warzone disguised as nightlife. I got lucky that night. Not because I fought — but because I didn’t have to.</p>
