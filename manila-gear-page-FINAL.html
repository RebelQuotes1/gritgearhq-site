      <h1>Trapped in a Manila Stairwell</h1>
      <p>
        It was just a layover. I was killing time between flights in Manila, wandering the airport halls looking for a smoking lounge,
        like the kind they have in Tokyo. Airports aren’t exactly known for friendliness, but when a local airport employee made eye contact
        and puffed an imaginary cigarette with a smile, I was relieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Want to smoke?” he asked, gesturing with his fingers. “Yes! Thanks!” I replied without hesitation. “Follow me,” he said casually,
        and I did. Why wouldn’t I? He had the uniform. The confidence. The vibe of someone doing a favor.
      </p>
      <p>
        He led me through a hallway, then through an unmarked door and into a concrete stairwell. That’s when I saw them — two more employees
        already waiting, like they'd been expecting me. But I’m not some lost retiree in cargo shorts. I’m 6’2, scrappy, and I’ve seen some things.
        And right then, something in the air shifted.
      </p>
      <p>
        I lit my cigarette anyway, watching their body language. They expected someone soft, maybe old, maybe female — someone who’d be easy to shake down.
        But I didn’t flinch. I stood my ground and took a drag. Then the demand came: “Money.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I laughed. “I don’t have anything for you,” I said calmly. The leader looked confused. Frustrated. Like the script wasn’t going how it usually does.
        The other two began to shrink back, casting sidelong glances that screamed regret. I could feel the power shift.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the ring leader reached out — I thought he wanted a drag of my cigarette, so I handed it to him. He stomped it out instead. I gave a little shrug
        and a half-smile. “Alright,” I said with the calm of someone who’s seen worse. “You fellas have a good day.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I walked out on my own terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could’ve ended different. If I were smaller, older, weaker — who knows? It reminded me how quick the illusion of safety can snap. Always stay sharp.
        Not paranoid. Just prepared.
