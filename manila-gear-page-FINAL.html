      <h1>Trapped in a Manila Stairwell</h1>
      <p>
        By the time I landed in Manila, I had already dodged more than a few shady situations. I’d spent time on the southern islands—
        places where even the locals walk with caution. There’s a certain smell in the air there, a damp rot of desperation and diesel fuel,
        mixed with cooking fires and bad intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was chasing something back then. I didn’t know what. Maybe meaning. Maybe danger. Maybe just the kind of story you can’t find in a brochure.
        I ended up at an illegal cockfight on one of those nights where time stops and the tension thickens like smoke. Roosters strapped with razors
        to their legs tore each other to shreds while men screamed, gambled, and drank like it was the only thing keeping them alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It felt like that Russian roulette scene from <em>The Deer Hunter</em>. No smiles. Just cold eyes, clenched jaws, and an unspoken dare
        floating in the air. One wrong look and you might end up part of the show. And yet… I stayed. I stayed because I didn’t want to leave afraid.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was the kind of mindset I had flying out of Cebu, exhausted and satisfied that I’d seen the “real” Philippines. But that’s the thing
        about ego — it doesn’t just get you into bad places, it keeps you from leaving them when you should.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was passing through Manila on a layover, just killing time in the airport. I’d been through Tokyo before and remembered their indoor
        smoking lounges, little fishbowl boxes where stressed businessmen puffed away without judgment. I figured Manila might have something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s when a guy in an airport uniform caught my eye and made a puffing motion with his fingers.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Want to smoke?” he asked with a grin.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hell yes,” I said, thankful.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Follow me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, he had the whole act down. Clean uniform, confident stride, the air of someone doing you a small, unofficial favor. I didn’t question it.
        I followed him through a side hallway, then a door, then into a quiet concrete stairwell where two other airport employees were already waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s when the energy changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        These weren’t coworkers on a break. They weren’t holding lighters or flicking ashes. They were waiting for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here’s what they didn’t count on: I’m 6’2", scrappy, and mean when I need to be. I’m not some clueless tourist. I wasn’t wearing flip-flops
        and a fanny pack. I didn’t flinch.
      </p>
      <p>
        I lit my cigarette anyway. Took a long drag and stared at each of them in turn. They looked younger than me. Skinnier. But their eyes gave them away —
        they were used to shaking people down. Probably easy targets: old men, solo women, soft bellies and fat wallets.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Money,” one of them finally said.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chuckled. “I don’t have anything for you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        That threw them off. The leader looked confused, like I skipped a line in the script. The other two started glancing around like maybe this wasn’t
        such a good idea. Like maybe this time they pulled in someone who’d bite back.
      </p>
      <p>
        We just stood there for a second, the four of us in that stairwell, smoke hanging in the air like a held breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the ring leader reached for my cigarette. I thought he wanted a drag, so I handed it to him without breaking eye contact.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stomped it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I nodded slowly, like I understood the message. Gave a little shrug. “Alright,” I said, real calm. “You fellas have a good day.”
      </p>
      <p>
        And I walked out. Didn’t run. Didn’t look back. Just walked like I belonged there more than they did.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could’ve ended different. If I were smaller. If I were timid. If I hesitated.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s what haunts me. Not the danger — the ease of it all. How close you can come to being a headline, a “traveler found dead”
        story tucked in the back of a newspaper.
      </p>
      <p>
        This wasn’t even in some back-alley bar or seedy neighborhood. This was in the damn airport. That illusion of safety? It’s just that — an illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        So yeah, travel. See the world. But don’t get soft. Gear up, wise up, and stay sharp. There are wolves at every gate — and not all of them snarl
        before they strike.
