      <h1>Trapped in a Manila Stairwell</h1>
      <p>
        By the time I landed in Manila, I had already dodged more than a few shady situations. I’d spent time on the southern islands,
        where poverty clung to the air like smog and some neighborhoods made Chicago look like Disneyland. I ended up at an illegal
        cockfight where the energy in the room was thick — money flying, men screaming, roosters armed with razors tearing each other apart.
        It felt like the Russian roulette scene in <em>The Deer Hunter</em> — unspoken tension, and everyone pretending things were normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew I had no business being there, but that’s how I traveled then — chasing stories, letting instinct guide me, trusting my gut
        more than any guidebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just a layover. I was killing time between flights in Manila, wandering the airport halls looking for a smoking lounge,
        like the kind they have in Tokyo. Airports
