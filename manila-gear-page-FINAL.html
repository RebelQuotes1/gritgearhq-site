      <h1>A Tense Moment in the Philippines</h1>
      <p>In my mid 20s, I had a long layover in Manila—a city known for extreme poverty and a reputation for muggings. I’d already been island-hopping, gone to a few sketchy cockfights (which felt like something out of *The Deer Hunter*), and ran into my share of trouble without too much damage.</p>
      <p>At around 4AM, craving a cigarette, I wandered the airport looking for a smoking area like they had in Tokyo. A uniformed airport worker asked me if I wanted to smoke. I nodded eagerly. He gestured for me to follow, and like a sleepy idiot, I did—right into a stairwell with two more guys already waiting.</p>
      <p>Now, I’m 6’2 and these guys were barely 5’7. My first thought was confusion. Then caution. I lit my cigarette, took a deep drag while eyeing each of them slowly, and finally handed it to the one reaching—intentionally pausing just enough to make it clear he was on my time, not the other way around.</p>
      <p>The guy took the cigarette… and stomped it out on the floor like a power move. Then he asked for money. I chuckled. “Alright then. Thanks.” I didn’t flinch. Just looked at him and the two others—who honestly looked terrified. He tried again. “Got any USD?” I said flatly, “I got nothin’ for you,” and walked out the door like I owned the stairwell.</p>
      <p>I figure their plan was to intimidate me into a big “tip,” or worse. Probably worked plenty of times on old tourists and women. But not this time. My calm, my height, and the confidence that I could pick one up and beat the others with him was enough.</p>
      <p>I love the Philippines—but it’s a strange place. Each island feels like a separate country with its own rules. I’m 41 now. You won’t catch me blindly following anyone anywhere, especially in a third world stairwell before dawn.</p>
