  <h1>💧 Top 5 Home Water Filters</h1>
  <p>Let’s get real — the water coming out of your faucet isn’t as clean as you think. Lead, PFAS “forever chemicals,” microplastics, and a cocktail of things you can’t even pronounce. You wouldn’t scoop water from a ditch and drink it raw, but a lot of tap water isn’t much better. That’s why a solid water filter isn’t a luxury — it’s survival gear for your kitchen.</p>

  <h2>1. LifeStraw Home Pitcher (10-Cup)</h2>
  <img src="images/wf.jpg" alt="LifeStraw Home Glass Water Filter Pitcher" />
  <p><strong>The survivalist’s countertop filter.</strong> LifeStraw took the same tech trusted by aid workers and backpackers around the world and poured it into a sleek glass pitcher. Inside, a two-stage filter system knocks out <em>bacteria, parasites, microplastics, heavy metals, and PFAS</em> — the nasty “forever chemicals” that don’t belong in your bloodstream. Unlike a lot of cheap pitchers, this one actually goes after the microscopic threats you can’t taste or smell.</p>
  <p>It’s BPA-free, dishwasher safe, and looks more like minimalist kitchenware than prepper gear — but under the hood, it’s built with survival DNA. If you want something that works every day <em>and</em> doubles as emergency gear, this is the pitcher that earns a permanent spot on your counter.</p>

  <h2>2. Brita Elite Pitcher Filter System</h2>
  <img src="images/elite.jpg" alt="Brita Elite Longlast Water Filter Dispenser" />
  <p><strong>The gateway filter.</strong> Everyone’s heard of Brita — but don’t confuse “familiar” with “weak.” The Elite series goes beyond taste improvement. It knocks down <em>lead, chlorine, cadmium, and mercury</em>, while giving your water that crisp, clean taste people swear by. Filters last up to six months, and replacements are everywhere — Target, Walmart, even grocery aisles. That convenience matters when you don’t want to wait on shipping for safe water.</p>
  <p>Sure, it’s not a hardcore survival system. But as an affordable, “first line of defense” that keeps poison out of your glass day after day, Brita Elite has earned its place in millions of homes. Think of it as basic armor — not bulletproof, but better than going unprotected.</p>

  <h2>3. Big Berkey Gravity Water Filter</h2>
  <img src="berky.jpg" alt="Big Berkey Gravity Water Filter Stainless Steel System" />
  <p><strong>The prepper’s gold standard.</strong> If the grid went down tomorrow, this is the system you’d want sitting on your counter. The stainless-steel Big Berkey uses powerful “Black Berkey” filters that remove <em>bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals</em> — basically the apocalypse buffet of contaminants. And it does it all without electricity or plumbing. Just pour dirty water in the top and gravity does the rest.</p>
  <p>With a two-gallon tank, it keeps a family hydrated without breaking a sweat. It’s not small, it’s not cheap, but it’s built like a tank and lasts for years. That’s why you’ll see Berkeys in off-grid cabins, storm shelters, and serious survivalists’ kitchens worldwide. For long-term resilience, nothing beats it.</p>

  <h2>4. AquaTru Countertop RO System</h2>
  <img src="aquatrue.jpg" alt="AquaTru Countertop Reverse Osmosis Water Filter with replacement filters" />
  <p><strong>The lab-grade purifier for your kitchen.</strong> Reverse osmosis is the gold standard in water purification, and AquaTru makes it plug-and-play. No plumber, no permanent installation — just set it on your counter, fill the tank, and it churns out water that’s been stripped of <em>lead, arsenic, PFAS, chromium-6, pharmaceuticals, nitrates</em>, and 80+ other contaminants. If you want your water to be nothing but H<sub>2</sub>O, this is the system.</p>
  <p>It’s perfect for families who want peace of mind without hacking into their plumbing. And unlike many RO systems, it wastes less water. Think of it as the digital detox of hydration — everything toxic gets erased, leaving only the essentials.</p>

  <h2>5. PUR Faucet Mount Filter</h2>
  <img src="purm.jpg" alt="PUR Faucet Mount Filter with replacement cartridge and packaging" />
  <p><strong>The quick fix.</strong> Not everyone can drop hundreds on a Berkey or AquaTru. That’s where PUR comes in. For the price of takeout, you can screw this filter directly onto your faucet and instantly cut out <em>lead, chlorine, and sediment</em>. It’s small, simple, and surprisingly effective for how little effort it takes.</p>
  <p>If you’re in an apartment, renting, or just starting to wake up to how bad tap water really is, this is the lowest barrier to entry. It’s not built for doomsday, but it turns questionable tap into drinkable water overnight — and that’s a win worth paying for.</p>

</div>

  <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> water is life. Don’t trust the city, don’t trust the pipes, and sure as hell don’t trust politicians promising “safe levels.” Get a filter, take control, and drink like you actually value your health. From a simple pitcher to a full RO system, one of these five will make sure what you’re swallowing is water — not a science experiment.</p>
