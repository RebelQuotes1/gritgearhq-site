    <h1>When Violence Is the Answer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>One night wasn’t even the worst I’ve been through. Nobody got stabbed. Nobody got shot. We all walked out alive. But it <em>could</em> have gone very differently. And that’s why it haunts me.</p>
      <p>It was a dive bar on the bad side of town — the kind of place where the beer is warm, the floor sticks to your boots, and the jukebox is always playing something you can barely hear over the tension in the room. I was there with a few buddies and my girl at the time. We were drinking. Laughing. Acting like kings of the gutter.</p>
      <p>That’s when she noticed her purse was gone. She’d left it on a barstool like we weren’t surrounded by vultures. I scanned the place and saw a group of gangbangers from Chicago posted up by the pool table — neighborhood muscle. They were the only ones close enough to swipe it.</p>
      <p>I walked over and asked. Calm. Direct. Not looking for a war — just her ID, her green card, maybe even her cash if it wasn’t gone yet.</p>
      <p>It simmered down. Barely. I went back to the bar and did what dumb men do when tension fades: I drank more. Got sloppy. Complacent. Decided to check the bathroom trash to see if they ditched the purse.</p>
      <p>I walked in alone. The door clicked behind me. Locked. Three of them had followed. No threats. No noise. Just three predators in a cramped, piss-slicked bathroom — and me.</p>
      <p>I didn’t flinch. Just slipped a hand into my pocket and gripped the switchblade. I didn’t open it. I didn’t flash it. Just waited. My dad’s voice hit me like a gunshot in my head: “Don’t ever pull a weapon unless you’re prepared to use it.” I was.</p>
      <p>We locked eyes. No one moved. One of them, the weakest link, backed off first. “I ain’t tryin’ to get cut,” he muttered before bailing. Now it was just me and two of them.</p>
      <p>One wanted it. You could see it in the way his muscles tensed. He was hungry for violence. But I didn’t blink.</p>
      <p>“I ain’t lookin’ for trouble,” I said.</p>
      <p>“Then what’s the knife for?”</p>
      <p>“It ain’t open… yet.”</p>
      <p>He saw it in my eyes. I wasn’t scared. I was <strong>ready</strong>. He blinked first. The other one talked him down, and they slipped out without another word.</p>
      <p>Didn’t find the purse. Didn’t care anymore. That night taught me the real danger isn’t always the fight. It’s the moment <em>before</em> — that fuzzy place where you let your guard down because violence hasn’t struck yet. Complacency. That’s what gets you killed.</p>
      <p>A few nights later, someone <em>did</em> get stabbed in that bar. Then someone else got run over in the parking lot. The place was cursed. It shut down soon after — good riddance.</p>
      <p>But I never forgot <strong>my</strong> night. Because nothing happened. And everything almost did.</p>
