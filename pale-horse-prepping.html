    <h1>Preparing for Revelations</h1>
    <p>Faith, survival, and finding clarity in a collapsing world.</p>

    <p>
      Throughout history, civilizations have looked to the skies, the scriptures, and their own nightmares 
      to try and make sense of endings. Call it the end times, Revelations, Ragnar√∂k, or simply collapse‚Äîthe idea 
      is the same: a reckoning comes. And when it does, the difference between those who crumble and those who endure 
      comes down to one thing‚Äîpreparation.
    </p>

    <h2>The Four Horsemen in Our Modern Age</h2>
    <img src="beast.jpg" alt="Four Horsemen depiction with apocalyptic backdrop">

    <p>
      The Book of Revelation speaks of conquest, war, famine, and death riding out across the land. Today, 
      those horsemen look different but feel eerily familiar: governments teetering, wars igniting, supply chains breaking, 
      diseases spreading faster than faith can keep up. Whether you believe prophecy literally or see it as metaphor, 
      the lesson remains: times of peace are the dress rehearsal, not the show.
    </p>

      <div>
        <p>When famine or supply collapse hits, food security is everything. Compact, long-shelf-life options like <a href="https://amzn.to/45MRwD9" target="_blank">Emergency Food Bars</a> 
        ensure you and your family aren‚Äôt left hungry when stores go dark.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Signs in the Skies</h2>
    <img src="meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor shower over burning city">

    <p>
      Fire from the heavens. The image has haunted humanity since the first thunderstorm rolled across 
      an open plain. We imagine meteors, nuclear fire, or simply skies filled with smoke. Science calls them 
      possibilities, scripture calls them signs. Either way, when skies burn, the time for debating theology is over. 
      You act, or you perish.
    </p>

    <div class="affiliate-box">
      <img src="dgt.jpg" alt="LifeStraw filter bottle">
      <div>
        <p>Clean water disappears faster than anything in a disaster. A rugged filter like the 
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3JATfnL" target="_blank">LifeStraw Peak Series</a> makes rivers and puddles safe again. 
        No sermons needed‚Äîjust drink and live.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>The Fragile Walls of Security</h2>
    <img src="mush.jpg" alt="Mushroom cloud explosion apocalyptic war">

    <p>
      If you‚Äôve ever walked through the rubble of war, you know that walls are fragile. Security is not about 
      police sirens or headlines‚Äîit‚Äôs about whether your door holds one more night, or whether the shadows 
      outside pass by without realizing you‚Äôre inside. In revelations‚Äîbiblical or personal‚Äîsafety is not 
      guaranteed. You create it, one boundary at a time.
    </p>

      <div>
        <p>Small devices can buy you big peace of mind. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3Hu50Mi" target="_blank">Tactiko Wire Trip Alarm</a> 
        creates a simple but effective perimeter‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre protecting a campsite, your family, or your sanity.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="affiliate-box">
      <img src="ds.jpg" alt="Door stop alarm">
      <div>
        <p>Sometimes salvation looks like something simple. The <a href="https://amzn.to/41o6bU5" target="_blank">Upgraded Door Stop Alarm</a> 
        turns any threshold into a warning system. A cheap insurance policy for uncertain nights.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Faith, Doubt, and the Space Between</h2>
    <p>
      Believers see Revelations as prophecy; atheists see it as metaphor. But what both sides share is a deep 
      awareness that our time here is fragile. The point of preparing isn‚Äôt just stockpiling beans or polishing rifles. 
      It‚Äôs cultivating the resilience to live fully in the present while being unflinchingly honest about the future.
    </p>

    <div class="affiliate-box">
      <img src="endt.jpg" alt="End Times Survival Guide book">
      <div>
        <p>If faith anchors you, or even if you just want to understand its survival lessons, 
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3Jw9qTp" target="_blank">The End Times Survival Guide</a> offers ten Biblical strategies 
        that bridge faith with practical living.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>The Gift of Preparation</h2>
    <p>
      Prepping for revelations isn‚Äôt about paranoia‚Äîit‚Äôs about refusing to go blind into the storm. Whether 
      you see it as prophecy or probability, the truth is simple: collapse comes for every empire, every family, 
      every individual. The choice is whether you meet it unprepared, or whether you stand ready, eyes wide open, 
      with faith in your chest and the right tools in your hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because in the end, revelations‚Äîbig or small‚Äîdon‚Äôt ask for permission. They arrive. 
      And what you do in those moments decides whether your story continues.
