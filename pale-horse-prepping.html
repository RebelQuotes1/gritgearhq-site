    <!-- ======= HERO / OVERVIEW ======= -->
    <section id="apocalypse-guide" class="sec sec--hero panel">
      <h1 class="title-xl">🐎 Preparing for the Pale Horse</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        If Revelation were fiction, the news wouldn’t keep spoiling the plot. The checklist is uncomfortably on-the-nose:
        wars and rumors of wars, famine and pestilence, earthquakes in “various places,” and a global fog of deception.
        You can call that coincidence, but when the same categories reappear across continents and headlines
        <em>at the same time</em>, that’s not noise—that’s pattern.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        The case isn’t built on one scary story; it’s built on convergence. <strong>Frequency:</strong> shocks arrive
        faster than they can be absorbed. <strong>Stacking:</strong> supply, energy, finance, and civil order now fail
        together because everything is lashed to everything. <strong>Amplification:</strong> lies scale instantly—
        deepfakes, bot swarms, polished “peace” pitches—so “many are deceived” stops sounding ancient and starts
        sounding like Tuesday. That’s exactly the shape the text said to watch for: conflict, scarcity, plague, tremor,
        and counterfeit saviors.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Why treat it as real? Because the downside of being wrong about calm is bigger than the downside of being right
        about readiness. If this is just another turn of the cycle, a resilient household still wins—lower bills,
        stronger habits, tighter community. If it’s the season Revelation described, then waiting for consensus is how
        you get trampled. Noah didn’t build a debate; he built a boat.
      </p>
      <p class="lead mb-0">
        This series lays the receipts on the table—Scripture first, headlines second—then turns conviction into a plan:
        water you can trust, food that actually feeds, light in a blackout, heat that doesn’t need a socket, and a home
        ordered enough to hold steady when the stage shakes. Birth pains mean a delivery is coming. Act like it.

    <!-- ======= RED HEIFERS ======= -->
    <section id="red-heifers" class="sec panel">
      <h2 class="title-lg">The Red Heifers in Israel: Prophecy in Plain Sight?</h2>
      <p class="para">
        In September 2022, five <em>pure</em> red heifers touched down in Israel from Texas—a detail most outlets filed
        under “quirky farm news.” It isn’t. In <strong>Numbers 19</strong>, the ashes of an unblemished red heifer—uniformly
        red, never yoked, no scars or marks, disqualified by even a couple of off-color hairs—are required for ritual
        purification before holy service can proceed. By rabbinic standards, raising a heifer that stays “qualifying red”
        into its third year is like threading a needle in a windstorm. Yet here they are, on Israeli soil.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Why does that matter? Because in both Jewish and Christian eschatology, a functioning Temple isn’t a metaphor; it’s
        a milestone. If a red heifer suitable for sacrifice exists, one of the <em>practical</em> obstacles to renewed Temple
        service moves from theory to logistics—livestock meets liturgy. Add the current reality on the ground—Temple Mount
        tension high, Jerusalem always one headline from global attention—and this “quiet import” starts to carry weight.
        You don’t need a date-setter to see the pattern: a biblical requirement long considered impossible now has living
        candidates, in the right place, during a season when the rest of the prophetic checklist (war, shaking economies,
        deception at scale) is already lighting the dashboard.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Is it the clincher? No—and it doesn’t have to be. Prophecy often signals by <em>convergence</em>, not a single smoking
        gun. The red heifers don’t prove the timeline; they <strong>tighten</strong> it. They move a line from “someday” to
        “ready when called.” When a detail as fussy as “two stray hairs” starts showing up in the news, Revelation stops
        feeling like poetry and starts reading like procedure.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        When placed alongside global events—wars in Eastern Europe, rising unrest in the Middle East, food insecurity,
        pandemics, and the looming threat of nuclear conflict—it’s no wonder people are asking if these ancient symbols are
        aligning with today’s headlines. Revelation speaks of conquest, war, famine, and death riding across the land. Do the
        red heifers mark one more hoofbeat echoing into our modern world?
      </p>
      <p class="para"><em>Whether you see them as holy signs or curious coincidences, the presence of these heifers
        reminds us: prophecy doesn’t live in the past. It breathes in the present.</em></p>

    <section id="fire-from-heavens" class="sec panel">
      <h2 class="title-lg">Fire from the Heavens</h2>
      <p class="para">
        The phrase still hits a nerve. Since the first storm split the night, people have watched the sky with equal parts
        awe and dread. Lightning, comets, meteors—every flash carried two messages at once: wonder to some, warning to others.
        That tension never left. Today the sky can burn three ways: by rock (a strike from space), by man (nuclear fire,
        hypersonics, satellites falling like rain), or by earth itself (forests torching, ash and smoke turning noon to Mars).
        Science files them under probabilities. Scripture—especially Revelation—files them under judgment. Different ledgers,
        same headline: vulnerability overhead.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Here’s the edge we stand on: when the heavens go red, the debate about metaphor versus prophecy stops mattering. A meteor
        doesn’t care which footnote you prefer. A plume on the horizon won’t pause for your paragraph. History’s record is blunt—
        civilizations don’t collapse for reading the signs too seriously; they collapse for treating the signs like scenery.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        So make the case simple and strong: convergence. Frequency is up; systems are linked; lies scale faster than truth; and
        the margin for error is thin. Revelation described a world like that—fire, trumpet, bowl, a planet learning the hard way.
        You don’t have to settle the timeline to settle your house. Filter the air, stage the water, know your shelter plan,
        harden comms, practice black-sky drills. Science can model the odds; Scripture can frame the moment. Wisdom turns both
        into a to-do list.
      </p>
      <p class="para mb-0">
        When the sky burns—whether from space rock, warhead, or a continent of trees—labels won’t shield your people. Action will.
        Argue later, on a full stomach and a charged radio.

      <p class="para">
        If you’ve ever walked through the rubble of disaster, you know how fragile walls really are. True security isn’t about
        sirens on the street or government alerts on your phone—it’s whether your door holds one more night, whether the
        floodwater keeps rising, whether your family can rest without fear, and whether the shadows outside pass by without
        realizing you’re inside.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        When the world feels like it’s cracking—whether you see it through Revelation or just modern chaos—safety is never
        guaranteed. It must be created. One choice, one habit, one boundary at a time.
      </p>

      <h3 class="title-lg mt-0">1. Awareness Before Action</h3>
      <p class="para">
        Most people fail in disaster not because they lack gear, but because they lack readiness. Know your exits. Learn the
        normal sounds of your home. Distinguish the wind rattling a window from someone testing a lock. Awareness is your first
        tool.
