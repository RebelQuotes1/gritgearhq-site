  <section id="manila" class="blog-post">
    <h2>Trapped in a Manila Stairwell</h2>
    <p>By the time I landed in Manila, I had already dodged more than a few shady situations. I’d spent time on the southern islands—places where even the locals walk with caution...</p>
    <p>I was chasing something back then. I didn’t know what. Maybe meaning. Maybe danger. Maybe just the kind of story you can’t find in a brochure...</p>
    <p>I ended up at an illegal cockfight... It felt like that Russian roulette scene from <em>The Deer Hunter</em>. No smiles. Just cold eyes, clenched jaws, and an unspoken dare floating in the air...</p>
    <p>That was the kind of mindset I had flying out of Cebu... I figured Manila might have something similar.</p>
    <p>That’s when a guy in an airport uniform caught my eye and made a puffing motion with his fingers. “Want to smoke?” he asked with a grin. “Hell yes,” I said, thankful. “Follow me.”</p>
    <p>Now, he had the whole act down. Clean uniform, confident stride, the air of someone doing you a small, unofficial favor... He led me into a quiet concrete stairwell where two other airport employees were already waiting.</p>
    <p>That’s when the energy changed. These weren’t coworkers on a break. They weren’t holding lighters or flicking ashes. They were waiting for me.</p>
    <p>But here’s what they didn’t count on: I’m 6’2", scrappy, and mean when I need to be. I’m not some clueless tourist... I lit my cigarette anyway. Took a long drag and stared at each of them in turn.</p>
    <p>“Money,” one of them finally said.</p>
    <p>I chuckled. “I don’t have anything for you.” That threw them off...</p>
    <p>Then the ringleader reached for my cigarette. I thought he wanted a drag. I handed it to him without breaking eye contact. He stomped it out.</p>
    <p>I nodded slowly. Gave a little shrug. “Alright,” I said, real calm. “You fellas have a good day.” And I walked out. Didn’t run. Didn’t look back. Just walked like I belonged there more than they did.</p>
    <p>Could’ve ended different. That’s what haunts me. Not the danger — the ease of it all...</p>
    <p>This wasn’t even in some back-alley bar or seedy neighborhood. This was in the damn airport. That illusion of safety? It’s just that — an illusion.</p>
    <p>So yeah, travel. See the world. But don’t get soft. Gear up, wise up, and stay sharp. There are wolves at every gate — and not all of them snarl before they strike.</p>
