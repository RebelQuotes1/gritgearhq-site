    <h1>Grit in the Cold: My Les Stroud Moment</h1>
    <p>When I first saw Survivorman, Les Stroud came on screen — calm, deliberate, alone in the wild — and something inside me lit up. It wasn’t inspiration. It was a challenge. I thought:

“If he can do it, so can I.”

So, naturally, I packed up the dumbest assortment of camping gear imaginable — gimmicky gadgets, canned food, an unrated sleeping bag — and trudged off alone into the snowy woods.

The temperature was somewhere south of 20 below. I didn’t check. I was too busy romanticizing the misery.

I had on blue jeans.
Not snow pants.
Not thermal layers.
And steel-toe boots that would later try to claim a few of my toes.

I talked two knucklehead friends into going with me.

One wussed out almost immediately after he lost feeling in his fingers and toes — tucked tail and headed back toward civilization.

The other was a rich kid with real gear: expensive winter clothing, actual thermal layers, and the kind of setup that didn’t scream death wish.

He didn’t exactly thrive out there, but it was bearable for him. I didn’t die because he let me sleep on his sleeping pad while he leaned against his backpack.

We crashed on either side of a 7-foot longfire, taking turns stoking it all night like cavemen guarding a sacred flame. We shivered, half-delirious, maybe half-dead, until morning light gave us the strength to hike back out — no glory, no trophies.

Just a cracked ego and a newfound respect for hypothermia.

Lesson learned:
Nature doesn’t care about your pride, your posturing, or your poor planning.
The wilderness is humbling — and it doesn’t hand out second chances.

Pack smarter.
Respect the elements.
And maybe don’t take inspiration so literally.

Shoutout to Wes, the friend with gear and a heart, for keeping my stubborn ass alive that night.
And thank you, Les Stroud — you didn’t just spark something in me…
You lit the fire I nearly froze beside.
