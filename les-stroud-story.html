  <h1>Grit in the Cold: My Les Stroud Moment</h1>
  <p>When I first saw “Survivorman,” something lit up inside me. Not inspiration — more like a challenge. Les Stroud was calm, alone, deliberate. I wanted that grit. So I packed up the dumbest assortment of camping gear imaginable — gimmicky gadgets, canned food, an unrated sleeping bag — and trudged off alone into the snowy woods.</p>
  <p>The temperature was somewhere south of 20 below. I didn’t check. I was too busy romanticizing the misery. I had on blue jeans. Not snow pants. Not thermal layers. And steel-toe boots that would later try to claim a few of my toes.</p>
  <p>My brilliant plan also included bringing along a small bottle of alcohol. I figured it’d help me sleep or maybe boost morale. What it did instead was drop my body temperature even lower while giving me the illusion that I wasn’t a first-class rookie.</p>
  <p>By the time I started hiking out, I had mild hypothermia and no backup plan. I remember thinking, “Les would’ve made a shelter. He would’ve paced himself. He would’ve brought actual gear.”</p>
  <p>But I didn’t die. I didn’t even get frostbite. What I got was humbled — and hooked. That weekend burned into me a different kind of toughness. I came back cold, hungry, and stupid. But also proud.</p>
  <p>Les didn’t inspire me to survive. He dared me to try.</p>
