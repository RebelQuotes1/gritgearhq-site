 <h1>Grit in the Cold: My Les Stroud Moment</h1>
<p>When I heard the forecast call it a "cord cold," that was my cue. Most folks take that as a warning. I took it as a dare.</p>
<p>I talked two knucklehead friends into joining me for a winter survival run. The plan? Head into the woods, build a massive lean-to, slap some mylar blankets up behind us, and bask in the radiant warmth of a roaring fire like three kings of the cold. It sounded solid in theory. On paper we were practically experts. In reality, we were flirting with frostbite.</p>
<p>The wind was brutal. The lean-to rattled like a cheap kite. Our fingers stopped working the way fingers are supposed to work. Water bottles froze solid. I could barely get a lighter to spark. One of the guys, the first to break — hit his limit and bailed back to the car before dark. The other stuck it out: a rich kid with a high-end setup. Real snow boots, thermal pants, a decent bag, and even a sleeping pad to keep the ground from leeching his body heat. I was running on stubbornness and false confidence.</p>
<p>We both laid out on either side of a long fire we had to keep alive all night, taking turns feeding it like it was our only lifeline because it was. I tried to dry my boots too close to the flames, and they started to melt. I trembled uncontrollably in and out of sleep, curled up in a half-shiver, half-delirium, wondering if this was the night I finally crossed the line from tough to stupid.</p>
<p>The only reason I didn’t end up in the obits for hypothermia is because my buddy took pity. He gave me his sleeping pad and leaned back against his own pack like a half-frozen Buddha in snow pants.</p>
<p>The next morning, we were wrecked. Our bones ached, our feet were numb, and our spirits were about one degree above dead. We trudged through a foot of snow half a mile to the trail, two more to the car. Didn’t talk much. Didn’t need to. We’d both survived something. Not epic. Not heroic. Just… real.</p>
<p>Cold has a way of stripping the fantasy off survival. It’s not about inspiration. It’s about figuring out what kind of man you are when there’s no one coming to save you.</p>
<p>And that weekend, I figured out I had more grit than gear — and just enough of both to make it home.</p>
