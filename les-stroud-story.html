    When things go sideways — when the power’s out, the roads are blocked, and you can’t call 911 — it won’t be the Instagram moms or corporate girlbosses who make it. It'll be the ones who planned ahead.
  </p>

  <p style="color:#ccc; max-width:850px; margin:0 auto 25px; font-size:1.1em; line-height:1.6;">
    Whether you’re a mom, daughter, nurse, badass, or all of the above — you need a survival checklist made for real-world chaos: <strong>assaults during blackouts, evacuation with kids, protecting yourself when laws vanish, handling hygiene when there's no plumbing, and dealing with men twice your size with half your morals.</strong>
  </p>

  <p style="color:#ccc; max-width:850px; margin:0 auto 25px; font-size:1.1em; line-height:1.6;">
    <strong>This isn’t fluff. This is Grit Gear.</strong> We built this list from hard lessons and field-tested realities. Inside the PDF:

    <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>“If he can do it, so can I.”</strong></p>
      <p>When I first saw <em>Survivorman</em>, Les Stroud came on screen — calm, deliberate, alone in the wild — and something inside me lit up.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t inspiration. It was a challenge. I thought: <strong>“If he can do it, so can I.”</strong></p>
      <p>So, naturally, I packed up the dumbest assortment of camping gear imaginable — gimmicky gadgets, canned food, an unrated sleeping bag — and trudged off into the snowy woods.</p>
      <p>The temperature was somewhere south of 20 below. I didn’t check. I was too busy romanticizing the misery.</p>
      <p>I had on blue jeans. Not snow pants. Not thermal layers. And steel-toe boots that would later try to claim a few of my toes.</p>
      <p>I talked two knucklehead friends into going with me. One wussed out almost immediately. The other let me sleep on his pad while he leaned against his backpack.</p>
      <p>We shivered all night beside a 7-foot longfire, flames snapping and crackling like it was trying to keep us sane. In the morning, we hiked back — no glory, no trophies. Just a cracked ego and a newfound respect for hypothermia.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>But the part that stuck with me — the part I can still feel in my bones — happened that first night, after the sun dipped behind the treetops and the real cold set in.</p>
      <p>Our water bottles had frozen solid by dusk.</p>
      <p>I learned the hard way that it takes a whole lot of snow to make even a little bit of water — especially if you don’t have clean ice. It’s like trying to hydrate with shaved disappointment.</p>
      <p>At some point, I peeled off my boots and was horrified. My toes looked like translucent white prunes — dead little fingers on the verge of giving up.</p>
      <p>I panicked. My stomach flipped. I knew if I didn’t act fast, I might lose them. So I stripped off my hoodie, wrapped it around my feet, and shoved both frostbitten blocks into the same sleeve — like they were huddling together in a buddy system.</p>
      <p>Then I slid into my sleeping bag — which was probably rated for summer in Florida — and drifted in and out of a half-sleep. I was shivering so hard I felt like I was vibrating between dimensions.</p>
      <p>Travis, the only other one dumb enough to stay, kept nudging me awake just as I started to fade. “Stoke the fire,” he’d whisper through chattering teeth.</p>
      <p>I’d fumble with frozen sticks, re-light the blaze, then fade back into a dreamy haze — only to wake him when it was his turn. Back and forth we went — like some kind of sleep-deprived survival ritual.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Later that night, we heard them.</p>
      <p><strong>Coyotes.</strong></p>
      <p>They circled our camp, snarling and pacing just outside the firelight. We could hear twigs snapping, the rustle of movement, and see their glowing eyes between the trees. It felt like we were being surrounded by ghosts with teeth.</p>
      <p>Then Travis snapped. He grabbed a large hunting knife and ran into the dark like a man possessed — yelling, swinging at shadows. It scared them off.</p>
      <p>I just sat there laughing. Not because it was funny — but because the entire thing was so absurd. We had no business being out there.</p>
      <p>But that moment taught him something about himself. About panic. About fear. About rising to the occasion — even if your plan is batshit insane.</p>
      <p>And me? I learned a little more respect for the wild. A little more humility. And a whole lot about what cold really means.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong><br>
        Nature doesn’t care about your pride or your poor planning.<br>
        The wilderness is humbling — and it doesn’t hand out second chances.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Shoutout to Wes, the friend with gear and a heart, for keeping my stubborn ass alive that night.</p>
      <p>And thank you, Les Stroud — you didn’t just spark something in me… You lit the fire I nearly froze beside.</p>
