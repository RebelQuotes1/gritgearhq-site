    <section>
      <h2>Act I: Baptism by Gunpowder</h2>
      <p>Born around 1783 in Pennsylvania, Hugh Glass strayed further than most men dared. By the 1810s he had fallen into the grip of <strong>Jean Lafitte’s pirates</strong> in the Gulf of Mexico, a floating kingdom where a man’s life was worth less than the powder in a pistol.</p>
      <p>When Glass tried to escape, the pirates decided to make an example of him. They dragged him before the crew, pressed a pistol to his temple, and pulled the trigger. <em>Click.</em> Misfire. Again. <em>Click.</em> A third and fourth time, the hammer fell on silence. The deck grew restless—bad omens ran deep in pirate blood. To prove the weapon wasn’t bewitched, the man aimed at the sea and squeezed once more. This time the pistol boomed, smoke rolling over the waves. Cursing, the pirate drew his cutlass to finish the job, but Glass slipped into the shadows, vanishing until night gave him cover.</p>
      <p>Soon after, their vessel grounded out on the Gulf Coast. The men camped, focused on survival and plotting their next push back to sea. Glass, ragged and desperate, kept to the treeline. He didn’t join them, didn’t risk exposure. He scavenged quietly, living on turtle eggs, shellfish, and seabirds caught with crude clubs. He drank rainwater when the sky allowed and stayed out of sight, a ghost at the edge of their camp.</p>
      <p>Among them was another fugitive—his details blurred by history. They weren’t companions; they hardly acknowledged each other. Yet when that man finally left the island to seek his way back to sea, he left something behind for Glass: a <strong>knife</strong>.</p>
      <p>For Glass, it was salvation. With steel in hand he could carve shelters, strip hides, build traps, and craft tools instead of clawing at survival barehanded. He remained on the island alone, honing the quiet stubbornness that would one day make him infamous. When a passing ship finally pulled him off the shore, Glass was scarred, starved, and half-dead—but alive. Already baptized in survival; already marked by the lesson that would define him: grit isn’t about glory. It’s about staying alive when the world has written you off.</p>

      <h2>Act II: Captive, Then Brother</h2>
      <p>Westward wanderings pushed Glass into another crucible: capture by the <strong>Pawnee</strong>. For most frontiersmen, that ended in torture. Glass’s story bent differently—he was spared. Why? Historians argue. He may have been adopted to replace a fallen warrior, or simply respected for an iron will that refused to snap.</p>
      <p>He lived with the Pawnee for <strong>years</strong>, long enough to marry into the tribe and to absorb survival knowledge until it lived in his hands. From them, Glass learned to track by bent grass and broken spider webs; to hunt with snares and patience instead of the thunder of a musket; to read weather as if it were scripture; and to respect a land that erases the careless. The pirate turned castaway became a frontiersman with two worlds in his blood.</p>

      <h2>Act III: Ashley’s Hundred</h2>
      <p>By the 1820s, pushing forty—old for a trapper—Glass signed on with <strong>Ashley’s Hundred</strong>, a brigade driving deep into the Upper Missouri. Beaver pelts were currency; everything else was hazard. These weren’t polite explorers. They were men with scars for faces, sleeping in mud, gambling their lives on rivers and ridgelines.</p>
      <p>Glass was built for it. Pirate, castaway, adopted Pawnee—he carried each life forward, tougher than most and twice as fluent in pain.</p>

      <h2>Act IV: The Bear</h2>
      <p>Summer 1823, near the Grand River. While scouting ahead, Glass stepped into a nightmare: a <strong>mother grizzly with cubs</strong>. He fired once and hit her. She charged anyway. In seconds she had him on the ground—scalp flayed, leg crushed, throat torn so deeply his companions later swore they could see daylight through the wound. She clawed his ribs until they showed.</p>
      <p>The trappers killed the bear, but what they found was a man shredded to the edge of silence—and somehow still breathing.</p>

      <h2>Act V: Buried Alive</h2>
      <p>They carried him as far as they could; he slowed them to a crawl. Captain Henry ordered two men—<strong>John Fitzgerald</strong> and a teenage <strong>Jim Bridger</strong>—to stay with Glass until he died, then bury him properly. They did neither. Convinced he wouldn’t last, they took his rifle and kit, scraped a shallow grave, and left him.</p>

      <h2>Act VI: The Crawl</h2>
      <p>Hugh Glass refused the schedule of death. He clawed out of the earth and began crawling. Over <strong>six weeks</strong>, he dragged himself more than <strong>200 miles</strong> to Fort Kiowa—on berries, roots, raw snakes. He drove wolves off a buffalo carcass and ate the rot. He splinted his own leg with sticks and rawhide. He packed mud into his wounds to fight infection. Most men would have begged for an ending. Glass bargained for another mile.</p>
      <p><em>Field note:</em> today we curse when a water filter clogs. Glass drank swamp water and thanked the mud for not killing him faster.</p>

      <h2>Act VII: Revenge (Sort Of)</h2>
      <p>At Fort Kiowa, stitched together by scars, he went after the men who left him. He found <strong>Bridger</strong> first—young and terrified—and spared him. He tracked <strong>Fitzgerald</strong> to a garrison; killing him would have earned a noose. Glass let him live, but history never forgave him. It wasn’t the blood he wanted, but sometimes outliving your enemies is revenge enough.</p>

      <h2>Act VIII: The Final Ambush</h2>
      <p>He returned to trapping because he didn’t know how to live any other way. Nearly a decade more of winters, raids, and hunger followed. In 1833, along the Yellowstone, an <strong>Arikara</strong> war party ambushed Glass and two companions. Arrows and numbers finally did what pirates, starvation, betrayal, and a grizzly couldn’t.</p>

      <h2>Why Hugh Glass Still Matters</h2>
      <p>Glass wasn’t a saint. He was a pirate, a fugitive, a frontiersman, and a survivor. His life carves one truth into stone: <strong>when death is certain, grit is the only weapon left</strong>.</p>

      <h2>What He Didn’t Have—And You Do</h2>
      <p>Glass survived on will alone. You don’t have to. Gear that echoes his ordeal—practical, packable, and worth their ounces:</p>

      <h2>Final Word</h2>
      <p>From a pirate’s misfiring pistol to a grizzly’s claws, Hugh Glass should’ve died a dozen times. He didn’t. He crawled when others quit. He forgave when rage would have consumed him. And he kept pushing until it took a war party to bring him down.</p>
      <p>That’s why his story still matters: survival doesn’t belong to the strongest or the smartest. It belongs to the stubborn.</p>
      <p><strong>One day your own “bear” will block the trail. Crawl, don’t quit.</strong></p>
