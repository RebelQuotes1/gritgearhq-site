      <p>Legal. Simple. Devastating. That‚Äôs a solid trifecta.</p>

  <h2>3 Ruthless Summer-Carry Weapons That Don‚Äôt Miss</h2>
  <p>When it‚Äôs 90 degrees and you're in shorts and a t-shirt, concealed carry gets complicated. You can‚Äôt strap a broadsword to your thigh and expect subtlety ‚Äî you need gear that‚Äôs lethal, low-profile, and built for the realities of summer survival. Whether you're walking downtown or cutting through backwoods, these three weapons bring the pain without weighing you down. Let‚Äôs talk tools ‚Äî not toys.</p>

  <h3>1. KA-BAR TDI Law Enforcement Knife</h3>
  <p>This isn‚Äôt some fantasy mall blade. The KA-BAR TDI was designed for law enforcement officers facing sudden, close-quarter attacks. Its curved design mimics natural hand movement, drawing like a punch and slashing like a razor. It hides along your beltline and deploys fast when seconds count. This isn‚Äôt about intimidation ‚Äî it‚Äôs about action. You don‚Äôt brandish this knife. You use it.</p>

  <h3>2. Cold Steel Urban Edge Push Dagger</h3>
  <p>Need something that vanishes until it matters? The Urban Edge push dagger is the answer. Worn around the neck or clipped discreetly, it‚Äôs shaped for instinctive grip and thrust. No awkward grip readjustments. No fumbling. This tool was made for blind corners, alleyways, and dark parking garages. One punch with this in your palm and your attacker is chewing curb.</p>

  <h3>3. Monkey Fist Steel Ball Keychain</h3>
  <p>This innocent-looking keychain is a street-smart bruiser‚Äôs best friend. Inside the braided paracord is a steel ball the size of a shooter marble ‚Äî and it hits like a meteor. Swing it like a sap, and you‚Äôve got a pocket-sized wrecking ball. Legal in most places, disguised as a key fob, and devastating when used right. Keep it in your hand while walking to your car and you‚Äôve already won half the fight.</p>
