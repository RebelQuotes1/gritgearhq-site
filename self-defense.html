      <h2>1. Byrna LE Kinetic Launcher</h2>
      <p>The Byrna is what you reach for when you need authority without a felony. It looks like a gun, but launches non-lethal pepper and kinetic rounds with enough sting to change minds fast.</p>
      <p>No permits needed. No deadly aftermath. Just you and a powerful tool that can end the fight before it starts. It’s rugged, tactical, and makes your front door feel a whole lot safer.</p>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>2. Cold Steel Brooklyn Smasher</h2>
      <p>This isn’t a toy—it’s a modern gladiator’s blunt melee equalizer. Built from unbreakable polymer, the Brooklyn Smasher is a legal and a great way to say "back off" without saying a word.</p>
      <p>Perfect for your car trunk or beside your bed. It looks like a bat, but swings like a war hammer. This thing eats wooden bats for breakfast and asks for seconds.</p>
      <p>Legal. Simple. Effective. That’s a solid trifecta.</p>

      <p>It's not too much—but it is over-prepared.</p>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>4. Spyderco Para Military 2</h2>

      <p>Its compression lock is buttery smooth, and the blade can cut through rope, fabric, plastic, or bad intentions without hesitation.</p>
      <p>If you only carry one blade—make sure it’s this one.</p>

    <h2>Summer Carry: 3 Solid Self-Defense Weapons That Won’t Weigh You Down</h2>
    <p>When the summer heat kicks in, it’s not just about hydration and shade — it’s about keeping your edge without carrying a toolbox on your belt. You want power, concealability, and grit — not sweat stains and jangling gear. Here are three self-defense tools that hit hard without making you look like you’re about to raid a compound.</p>

    <h3>1. CHAOS Ambidextrous Push Knife</h3>
    <p>Compact, intimidating, and forged from a single piece of steel — this boot knife isn’t for showing off. It’s for up-close survival. Tucks clean inside your boot or waistband and disappears until it’s time to show your teeth. No frills. No nonsense. Just steel and resolve.</p>
    <p><a href="https://amzn.to/4jHfjJD" target="_blank">Get it Here →</a></p>

    <h3>2. Tactical Window and Skull Breaker</h3>
    <p>Small enough to disappear in your pocket, tough enough to punch above its weight. The SOG Instinct Mini is a neck knife that screams utility and last-resort grit. Great for minimal carry, backup defense, or even daily tasks that keep your blade hand sharp.</p>
    <p><a href="https://amzn.to/4jJKNyZ" target="_blank">Get it Here →</a></p>

    <h3>3. Streetwise Pain Pen 25,000,000 Stun Gun</h3>
    <p>This beast masquerades as a pen but drops voltage like it means it. Sleek enough for summer carry, serious enough to leave someone stunned in their flip-flops.</p>

    <p><em>Reminder: Know your local laws. These are tools, not toys. Respect the blade, respect the rules, and be the guy who’s always ready — but never reckless.</em></p>

  <p><em>Prep doesn’t stop when it gets hot — it just changes form. Travel light, stay dangerous, and remember: Sweat more in peace and bleed less in war.</em></p>
