    <h1 style="color:#ffa500; font-size:2.5em;">🥵 How to Keep Cool During a Power Outage in the Mississippi Delta</h1>
    <p style="font-size:1.2em; line-height:1.6;">
      When the grid goes dark in the heat of summer, comfort becomes survival. It’s not just about sweating less — it’s about protecting the ones you love from heat exhaustion, dehydration, and the kind of stress that slowly breaks people down.
    </p>

    <p>We live in the Mississippi Delta, where the humidity is thick enough to chew, and the heat doesn’t just make you uncomfortable — it tests you. After a rogue tornado ripped through our county, we were left in the dark for two weeks. Fourteen days of rising heat, spoiled food, and stressed families.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#ffa500;">🧊 Tip #1: Freeze Plastic Bottles</h2>
    <p>Freeze empty water bottles ahead of time. These poor man’s ice packs can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cool your core on contact</li>
      <li>Keep your cooler chilled longer</li>
      <li>Become drinking water as they melt</li>
      <li>Help with injuries during hikes or bug-outs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color:#ffa500;">🌬️ Tip #2: Use Portable Fans</h2>
    <p>
      Rechargeable fans like the <a href="https://amzn.to/4lKpvmy" target="_blank" style="color:#7fdfff;">FRIZCOL 3-in-1 Camping Fan</a> (140+ hrs runtime) can literally be lifesavers. Place them near a wet towel or a pan of ice for makeshift evaporative cooling. Pocket fans and neck fans for kids also help distract and comfort.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ffa500;">🔌 Tip #3: Rotate Portable Power</h2>
    <p>
      Alternate Jackery-style battery banks. One charges, the other runs your AC or fans. We got about 4 hours of AC per day this way — crucial during peak danger hours (12–3 PM).

    <h2 style="color:#ffa500;">🧒 Tip #4: Keep Kids Cool & Distracted</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Teach them to fold paper fans</li>
      <li>Spritz them with water bottles</li>
      <li>Wrap cold cloths around their heads</li>
      <li>Let them rest on cots, not the floor</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color:#ffa500;">🍳 Tip #5: Don’t Cook Indoors</h2>
    <p>Cooking inside during extreme heat is a bad idea. It raises your indoor temp fast. Cook early, cook late, and cook outside under shade.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#ffa500;">🔥 Real Story: The Cocky Neighbor</h2>
    <p>I’ve got a young neighbor. Cocky. His kids were red and sweaty, wife visibly stressed. I offered a few suggestions — nothing preachy. He shot them down with that classic “we’re fine” tone. Meanwhile, my family was cool, hydrated, and calm. Why? We were prepared.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#ffa500;">⚠️ Death by Heat Exhaustion: True Case</h2>
    <p>A man one county over wasn’t so lucky. 61. Tried to tough it out. Minimal airflow. Closed up house to keep the fridge cold, but never drank the water. Died in his chair. A $20 fan and cold bottle could’ve saved him.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#ffa500;">⚙️ Bonus Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Open windows, but keep blinds down</li>
      <li>Cover windows with emergency blankets</li>
      <li>Hold a cold bottle against neck arteries to lower body temp</li>
      <li>Minimize physical activity during peak hours</li>
      <li>Sleep outside under mesh canopies if needed</li>
    </ul>

<h2 style="color:#ffa500;">💦 Tip #6: Let Nature Do the Cooling</h2>
<p>
  When your body’s screaming for relief and your gear is maxed out, it’s time to find water. Local swimming holes, splash pads, rivers, creeks — even a backyard kiddie pool — can buy you hours of cooling and peace. If you’re lucky enough to live near a water park, use it. 
</p>
<p>
  It’s not just fun — it’s smart. Keeping your kids soaked helps regulate their core temp and gives them something to look forward to. Shade and hydration do the rest.
</p>
<p>
  No natural water nearby? Fill a plastic tub with hose water. Rotate the family through it. Use spray bottles. Mist your face, hair, and neck. Cooling off doesn’t always take fancy gear — sometimes it just takes a little ingenuity.
