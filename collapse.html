  <h1 id="collapse-blog">5 Things I No Longer Buy Since Realizing Western Society Is Doomed</h1>

  <p>Once you stop pretending things will ‚Äúgo back to normal,‚Äù your priorities begin to shift. You start living like the system could fail tomorrow. Because, my friend, it just might. I didn‚Äôt plan on becoming a 'survivalist'. I just try to plan ahead on a regular basis. "A scout's always prepared" we used to say. (I know, hard to imagine me as a Boyscout, right?) However, once I did begin to take shit more seriously lot of the things I used to spend money on started to feel... stupid.</p>

  <p>Here are 5 things I quit buying after realizing the empire‚Äôs on its last legs, and what I use instead.</p>

  <h2>1. Name brand clothes</h2>
  <p>Back when I thought society had a future, I wasted cash chasing style. Shirts with brand names. Over-priced work boots. Now? I dress for durability, not dopamine.</p>
  <div class="product-block">
    <p><strong>Tactical Waterproof Pants</strong> ‚Äî Rugged, breathable, and built for collapse.</p>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3zZKdfM?tag=gritgear-20" target="_blank">See price on Amazon ‚Ä∫</a>

  </div>

  <h2>2. Fabric Softener and Dryer Sheets</h2>
  <p>Softness is a luxury. I used to buy dryer sheets to feel clean and comfy. But once you realize society‚Äôs unraveling, you don‚Äôt want your clothes ‚Äúsoft‚Äù you want them tough.</p>
  <div class="product-block">
    <p><strong>Low-waste laundry sheets</strong> ‚Äî travel-ready and chemical-free.</p>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3W6fEtY?tag=gritgear-20" target="_blank">See it ‚Ä∫</a>

  </div>

  <h2>3. Bottled Water</h2>
  <p>If you‚Äôre still relying on bottled water, you‚Äôre not serious about collapse. We use a <strong>Brita pitcher</strong> at home, but for real preparedness, I grabbed a gravity-fed filter that works off-grid.</p>
  <div class="product-block">
    <p>‚úÖ <strong>Survivor Filter Pro X</strong><br>This beast filters viruses, bacteria, and heavy metals‚Äîno electricity needed. I trust it enough to keep one in my bug-out bag.</p>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/4ctigLE?tag=gritgear-20" target="_blank">Check it out ‚Ä∫</a>

  </div>

  <h2>4. Tobacco</h2>
  <p>I gave it up when I realized I might need to <strong>run, climb, or fight</strong> during a blackout. Tobacco‚Äôs not just expensive, it‚Äôs a liability. How can I call myself a real man if I can't even run carrying my daughter in the event of an emergency? It's your responsiblity to your family or tribe that get and stay in atleast half-ass fighting condition</p>
  <div class="product-block">
    <p><strong>NicoDerm CQ Nicotine Patches</strong> ‚Äî If you're quitting for real, this is the "easy" route, but believe me, none of us are going to judge. And it's still not going to be easy. I took all the help I could get and these patches helped soften the jagged edges of withdrawal in the beggining util i went cold turkey. That being said, once you finally make that decision and it clicks in your brain that you're finally done with coughing up phlem, being broke and smelling bad, it actually becomes suprisingly bearable.</p>

  <h2>5. Pointless Gadgets and Cheap Junk</h2>
  <p>Now I ask: Will it help me <strong>survive a blackout, defend my home, or stay mobile when the grid fails?</strong> If not, I pass.</p>
  <div class="product-block">
    <p><strong>Gerber Suspension Multi-Tool</strong>  not flashy, just reliable.</p>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3QvPBFS?tag=gritgear-20" target="_blank">See price ‚Ä∫</a>

  </div>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  <p>The illusion of stability is dead. I don‚Äôt prep because I‚Äôm paranoid. (Though that is debatable.) I prep because I‚Äôm awake and because I accept the responsibility of keeping my family safe and well. Every dollar I <em>don‚Äôt</em> spend on fluff is a dollar I put toward freedom, protection, and peace of mind.</p>
  <p>Start by cutting the crap. Then build up the gear that matters.

Bottom line: Be honest with yourself and ask what are some little things that are holding you back? And then do something about it. </p>
