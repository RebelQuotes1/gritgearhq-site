      <p><strong>Grit in the Cold:</strong> My Les Stroud Moment at 21 was when I first saw *Survivorman*. Les Stroud came on screen‚Äîcalm, deliberate, alone in the wild‚Äîand something inside me lit up. It wasn‚Äôt inspiration. It was a challenge. I thought, ‚ÄúIf he can do it, so can I.‚Äù So, naturally, I packed up the dumbest assortment of camping gear imaginable‚Äîgimmicky gadgets, canned food, an unrated sleeping bag‚Äîand trudged off alone into the snowy woods. The temperature was somewhere south of 20 below.

      I didn‚Äôt check. I was too busy romanticizing the misery. I had on blue jeans. Not snow pants. Not thermals. Jeans. And steel-toe boots that would later try to claim a few of my toes. My brilliant plan also included bringing along a small bottle of alcohol. I figured it‚Äôd help me sleep or maybe boost morale. What it did instead was drop my body temperature even lower while giving me the illusion that I was warm‚Äîclassic rookie move.

      By the time the breath started curling in my pants and freezing into rigid ice sheets, I knew I had made a huge mistake. I remember trying to start a fire with one forgotten little starter that I barely knew how to use‚Äîand losing the will to grip anything. The snow beneath me melted from my heat and turned into ice water. But I stayed alive that night. I curled up beside a 7-foot-long logfire and kept it going like my life depended on it‚Äîbecause it did. I was half-conscious, shivering between dreamlike blackouts, waking only to feed the flames and keep death from creeping in. By morning, I was a wreck. I stumbled back through the woods, barely coherent, fighting panic, numb from the waist down.

      I got lucky. Real lucky. I didn‚Äôt lose any toes, but it was close. My boots felt like coffins for my feet. That night taught me more about survival than any TV show ever could. It wasn‚Äôt about heroism or being hardcore. It was about humility. And the very real, very stupid ways we underestimate nature. If Les Stroud had been there, he probably would've smacked me upside the head with a pine branch and told me to go home. And he would've been right.

      But I came out of those woods different‚Äîhumbled, frostbitten, and one step closer to grit. Shout out to Les for starting my journey.</p>
