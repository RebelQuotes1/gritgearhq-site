    <h1>⚠️ A Night at the Dive Bar</h1>

    <p>It was a beat-down dive on the wrong side of town, the kind of place where pool tables are tilted, the jukebox skips, and everybody's got a story they don’t tell out loud. I was there with my old girlfriend—early 20s, broke, reckless, and half in love with chaos.</p>

    <p>We’d been drinking cheap whiskey and feeding dollars to the jukebox. She turned her back for ten seconds to pick a song—just ten seconds—and that’s all it took. Her purse vanished from the edge of the table. There were three guys nearby, gang-affiliated, watching us like vultures pretending to be bystanders. I knew in my gut it was them.</p>

    <p>I approached calmly—no shouting, no threats. Just that cold, calculated tension in the air. I asked if they saw anything. One laughed. One stared. The third said nothing at all. Things got hot fast. Voices rose. Chairs scraped. The bouncer stepped in before it turned violent, and they acted like it was no big deal. Like they’d already won.</p>

    <p>I should’ve left. But I was pissed off, and pride’s a hell of a drug. I took a few more shots, just enough to cloud my edges—and that’s when I made my second mistake: I went to the bathroom alone to search the trash can for my braindead girl's purse.</p>

    <p>It was one of those narrow, grimy back bathrooms with flickering lights and a broken stall door. I stood at the sink, washing my hands, trying to calm down—but deep inside, I already knew. I could feel it coming. The air shifted. so with wet hands I pulled out my switchblade and held it down to my siode unopened with my finger on the trigger button. Just then, footsteps behind me.</p>

    <p>Three of them entered.</p>

    <p>One stopped dead in his tracks, glanced at the knife in my hand. “I ain’t trying to get cut,” he said, and dipped right back out the door. That was the smart one.</p>

    <p>The second leaned against the wall, arms crossed, eyes locked on mine. No words. Just the kind of stillness that makes your skin crawl—like a snake coiled before the strike. The third? He stepped forward. Slow. Deliberate. Testing me.</p>

    <p>What he didn’t know was I had already made my decision. I wasn't going to be a victim. I had a blade tucked near my waistband, small but wicked. I’d carried it since county jail, out of habit more than fear. Tonight, it felt like prophecy.</p>

    <p>I didn’t say a word. I just turned, pulled the blade, and held it low—angled up. That quiet kind of threat. Not the kind you yell. The kind that ends conversations.</p>

    <p>The second guy shifted. The third one froze. I stepped closer. My eyes didn’t blink. My heart was hammering, but my hands were still.</p>

    <p>I was ready to bleed. More importantly, I was ready to make them bleed first.</p>

    <p>That’s when they realized it. The vibe changed. I wasn’t scared. I was waiting. "I don't want any trouble" I said. "Whatchu got a knife foe if you don't want no problems?" he replied. Calmly I said "It ain't open... yet" I remembered my father telling me to never pull a weapon unless i have every intension of using it, so i was keeping it closed until the last minute. It wasnt fear, it was control>They left.</p>

    <p>I stood in that grimy little bathroom for another full minute, breathing heavy, blade still in hand. Not because I was trying to be a badass—but because my body needed time to catch up to the decision I had already made. To live. No matter what.</p>
