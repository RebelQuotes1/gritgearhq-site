    <h1>Would You Rather: Alone with a Man or a Bear?</h1>

    <img src="manbear.jpg" alt="Man and Bear in the Woods">

    <p>Let’s say you get dropped deep into the wilderness. No signal. No backup. Just you—and one companion, chosen at random: either a man… or a bear. Who do you choose?</p>

    <p>This “funny” question often floats around social media—but the answers aren’t always lighthearted. Shockingly, a significant number of women say they’d rather be with the bear. Why? Because “at least the bear isn’t sexist.” Or “the bear isn’t a threat.”</p>

    <p>But let’s actually analyze that.</p>

    <h2>Man or Bear: Who’s More Dangerous?</h2>

    <p>The bear is a wild apex predator. It can smell you from miles away, run 35 mph, climb trees, and crush a skull with a swipe. It doesn’t have ethics. It doesn’t warn you. If it’s hungry or startled, you're done.</p>

    <p>A man, on the other hand, might be a risk. Sure, he might be a predator, or a sadist, or just a jerk. But he might also be a rescuer. A protector. A lifeline. He might know how to build a fire, filter water, signal for help. Or he might kill you. That’s the gamble. But unlike the bear, he can make moral choices—and that counts for something.</p>

    <h2>The Head Pat Test</h2>

    <p>Try this: would you feel safer patting a random bear on the head—or a random man?</p>
    <p>If you said bear, you’ve lost touch with reality. You don’t pat apex predators. Not if you want to live.</p>

    <h2>What If It Was 40 of Them?</h2>

    <p>Would you rather be alone in the woods with 40 men… or 40 bears?</p>
    <p>If you answered “bears,” it’s not empowering—it’s delusional. That’s not a flex. That’s the trauma talking. And we get it. But it’s time for honest reflection.</p>

    <p>Women aren’t “wrong” for feeling unsafe. But some are being conditioned to distrust men no matter what. If given the option between a potentially helpful human and a wild animal, choosing the animal just to spite men says more about cultural programming than logic.</p>

    <h2>Reality Check</h2>

    <p>Social experiments have shown women overwhelmingly say “yes” to negative stereotypes about men—statements that are provably false. But it's not really about facts. It’s about fear. And bitterness. And disappointment. We understand.</p>

    <p>But men aren’t mad. We’re dumbfounded. And yeah—some of us are hurt. Because we know that if the roles were reversed, most men would protect you, not harm you.</p>

    <h2>The Real Test</h2>

    <p>If you were dropped in the forest with both a man and a bear, who would you choose to stand beside?</p>

    <p>And here’s a follow-up for the men: would you feel safer opening up to a woman… or a tree?</p>

    <p>Let that sink in.</p>
