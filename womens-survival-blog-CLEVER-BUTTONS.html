    <h1>Prepping Like a Woman</h1>

    <p>When people picture survivalists, they imagine grizzled old men in camo—chewing jerky beside a fire they lit with their beard hair. But real survival doesn’t care what gender you are. It only cares if you’re ready.</p>

    <p>Here’s the truth: women have been prepping their entire lives. Every time you walked to your car with keys between your fingers. Every time you scanned a room and clocked exits. Every time you said “text me when you get home.” That’s survival instinct. It's baked in.</p>

    <p>This isn’t about becoming someone new. It’s about recognizing the fighter you already are—and turning that alertness into a weapon.</p>

    <h2>🧠 1. Your Intuition Is a Weapon</h2>
    <p>If something feels off, it is. In a world without rules, hesitation is deadly. You’re not being “dramatic”—you’re being alive. Gut feelings save lives. Trust yours.</p>

    <h2>🧼 2. Hygiene Isn’t Luxury—It’s Lifesaving</h2>
    <p>Think infections, not inconvenience. A UTI or yeast infection during collapse isn’t just annoying—it can take you out. Prep your hygiene like your life depends on it—because it might.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reusable menstrual products</li>
      <li>Mini bidets, soap sheets, gloves</li>
      <li>Breathable underwear & wipes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛡️ 3. Self-Defense Is Non-Negotiable</h2>
    <p>You don’t have to be aggressive. Just ready. Whether that’s pepper spray, a stun device, or learning to snap an arm with a shoelace—be dangerous enough to make it out alive.</p>

    <h2>🩸 Real Survival: Maria’s Story</h2>
    <p>Maria was a city girl—no combat training, no firearms, no bug-out bag. But when the blackout hit and someone tried to force open her back door at midnight, she didn’t freeze. She <em>moved</em>.</p>

    <p>She grabbed a tactical pen from her junk drawer—something her sister had given her “just in case.” She crouched behind the kitchen counter and waited. The man broke in. He was bigger, louder, cocky. But Maria was ready.</p>

    <p>She lunged, jammed the pen in his neck, and shoved him into the pantry shelf. While he screamed and staggered, she sprinted barefoot to the neighbor’s window.</p>

    <p>Police said she saved her own life. But Maria knew better: she <em>transformed</em> that night. She never doubted herself again.</p>

    <blockquote>"I wasn't ready. But I didn't need to be perfect. I just needed to be dangerous enough to survive."</blockquote>

    <h2>🎒 4. Pack Like You Mean It</h2>
    <p>This isn’t a Hollywood bug-out fantasy. Pack light, move fast, rest smart. Your gear should match <em>your</em> life—not someone else’s dream setup.</p>

    <h2>🕵️ 5. Silence Is Strength</h2>
    <p>Being invisible is underrated. Quiet boots, dark clothing, no clanking metal or perfume trails. Survival means <strong>not</strong> being noticed when it counts.</p>

    <h2>🔥 6. You’ve Already Survived Worse</h2>
    <p>Most women have survived trauma, betrayal, fear, isolation, heartbreak—or all of the above. You’re not weak. You’re battle-tested. This world just forgot how strong you really are.</p>
