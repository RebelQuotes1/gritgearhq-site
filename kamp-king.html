  <p>This thing surprised the hell out of me.</p>

  <p>I expected it to be a cheap gimmick — a retro-looking folder you'd toss in the glovebox and forget about. But the Kamp King has that old-school pocketknife charm with actual functionality baked in. The kind of blade your grandfather might’ve used to gut fish or open a beer — and it's still doing the job today.</p>

  <p>It’s sturdy. Not perfect, but sturdy. The pull is tight, the tools lock into place well enough, and it feels like it was made for real use, not just display. This isn’t your $200 survival blade — it’s your “ride-along, tear-up-some-cardboard, open-a-can-of-chili” kind of knife.</p>

  <p>I oiled mine up with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LC9YM8?tag=gritgearhq-20" target="_blank">Hoppe’s No. 9 Lubricating Oil</a>, and now it opens like butter. The blade sharpens up fast, and the can opener on the side has already earned its keep on a few trips.</p>

  <p>And don’t forget – this kind of knife loves a little oil. I’ve used 
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LC9YM8?tag=gritgearhq-20" target="_blank">Hoppe’s No. 9 Lubricating Oil</a> for years to keep blades smooth, rust-free, and ready. It’s cheap insurance for any tool you plan to trust when it counts.</p>

  <p>This one’s not tactical. It’s practical. It’s nostalgic. It’s affordable. It’s reliable.</p>

  <p>Hell, I might buy a second one just to leave in the tackle box.</p>
