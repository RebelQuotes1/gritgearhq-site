  <h1>How to Survive Jail (and Keep Your Soul Intact)</h1>

  <p>First things first: If you’re reading this, you’re either already preparing for a stay in county, worried you might catch a case, or just have a morbid curiosity about what it’s like to be stripped of your freedom and handed a jumpsuit that smells like despair. Jail isn’t a Hollywood movie. It’s boredom, bad lighting, and the sound of other men snoring, farting, yelling, or crying themselves to sleep.</p>

  <p>Walking into booking is like stepping into purgatory. You’ll be led in, fingerprinted, photographed, and herded like cattle into holding tanks that reek of bleach, ass, and anxiety. There’s no privacy. There’s nowhere to run. Your whole life is now on pause, and the only thing that matters is how you hold your composure.</p>

  <p>Rule one: <strong>Shut up.</strong> Don’t get friendly. Don’t talk about your case. Don’t brag. Don’t act like you’ve done time unless you have. Nobody cares about your resume, your lawyer, or your sob story. The more you talk, the more you give away. And trust me, gossip spreads faster than pink eye in a pod full of tweakers.</p>

  <p>Rule two: <strong>Mind your debt.</strong> Don’t borrow food. Don’t borrow phone time. Don’t ask for anything you can’t pay back. That one honey bun could end up costing you your dignity, or a tooth. There are inmates doing five months who act like they run the yard. Let them. Your job is to survive and get out with your sanity intact.</p>

  <p>While you’re in there, time will either rot you or sharpen you. And if you’re lucky enough to still be on the outside but facing a long court battle, use that time wisely. Back then I didn’t have the tools I do now—but I sure as hell wish I did.</p>

  <p><strong>David Goggins’ book, “Can’t Hurt Me”</strong>, is like a slap from God and a hug from the Devil. It's brutal honesty that makes your excuses shrivel. It gave me the kind of perspective that would've helped me get my mind right when I felt like a ticking bomb.</p>

  <p>I also wrote my own book, <strong>“How to Unf*ck Your Life”</strong>. It’s raw, honest, and packed with the kind of dark humor and hard-won lessons I wish someone would've given me when I was pacing in a 6x8 cage trying not to snap.</p>

  <p>As for your body, don’t let it turn into pudding. Jail will do that to you if you let it. Working out in a cell is a mind game more than anything else. You don’t need a gym—just resistance and determination. I use these <strong>heavy resistance bands</strong> now to stay strong. They would’ve been a godsend in those days.</p>

  <p>Stay sharp. Stay focused. And most of all, don’t give in to despair. That place wants to break you. Don’t let it. Once you get out, use that newfound knowledge that you can survive anything. Grow from it, learn and gain hard earned wisdom rather than a cycle of mistakes.</p>
