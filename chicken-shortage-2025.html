<h1>üêî The Chicken Shortage of 2025 Is Real. And I‚Äôm Raising My Own</h1>

<p>First it was the Covid lockdown toilet paper hoarding. People buying up pallets of TP to scalp on the side of the road for a giant markup in price. Well, now it‚Äôs chickens. And I‚Äôm not exaggerating, prices are out of control and farms are having waiting lists. Some people are charging <strong>$35 per bird</strong> on Marketplace or Craigslist. My wife and I got lucky with an ad I found on craigslist. Two hours after responding to the listing and we were already meeting the guy in the parking lot of Tractor Supply. We snagged 5 hens for <strong>$70 total</strong>, which feels like a heist compared to what others are paying.</p>

<p>We got a late start in the day and didn't really prepare, so we ended up chasing birds around the neighborhood like lunatics. Clipping wings, corralling them into the backyard, patching up gaps in our makeshift chickenwire fence. We‚Äôve only got a 5-foot fence, but after clipping, they don‚Äôt even try to escape. Truth is, they don‚Äôt want to leave because to a chicken our backyard is a damn paradise.</p>

<p>I turned our shed into a temporary coop while I fix up the old one right beside it. We‚Äôve got a compost pile, a wild patch for butterflies and dragonflies, a small pond with a fountain, and plenty of shade. The chickens love it. They‚Äôve got everything they need. And best of all, I‚Äôve got eggs, pest control, and peace of mind.</p>

<h2>Why Everyone‚Äôs Grabbing Chickens Right Now</h2>
<p>People sense it, even if they can‚Äôt say it out loud. The world‚Äôs extremely unstable. Food prices are stupid. Depending on grocery stores feel like a gamble. We remember how quickly store shelves can be picked bare when people panic. So folks are grabbing chickens like it‚Äôs the new toilet paper craze. Self-reliance is cool again.</p>

  <img src="tpost.jpg" alt="fence posts">
  <p>These 5-foot heavy-duty metal U-posts are the real deal. I used them when my flock decided the grass was greener next door ‚Äî and I wasn‚Äôt about to let some chickens outsmart me. No digging required. Just line ‚Äôem up and slam them in with a sledgehammer like you're staking out territory in the apocalypse. They don‚Äôt budge, and they don‚Äôt rust.</p>

  <p>First time I put these in, I was barefoot, half-caffeinated, and still managed to build a solid perimeter before noon. If I can do that with one bad ankle and a chicken pecking at my toes, you‚Äôll be just fine.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://amzn.to/3UNGrN9?tag=gritgearhq-20" target="_blank">üçΩÔ∏è 3.6 Gallon Chicken Feeder Bucket w/ Anti-Roost Cone & Adjustable Legs</a></h3>
  <img src="feeder.jpg" alt="chicken feeder bucket">
  <p>This ain't some flimsy plastic bin from the dollar store, this is the exact type of feeder my best friend Ballard gave me to start me off with my first two chickens in 2019 and it is still being used by my current chickens today August 7, 2025. So that should tell you that this chicken feeder is built like a tank. Keeps feed dry in the rain, the cone keeps birds from turning it into their personal roost, and the adjustable legs mean it works no matter how uneven your yard is. Minimal waste, zero hassle. Just fill it and forget it for days.</p>

  <p>First time I filled it up and set it inside their coup, my birds looked at me like I was a damn genius. They ate in peace, didn‚Äôt knock it over and not from lack of trying, and I didn‚Äôt have to crawl into the coop every morning like some medieval feed wench. This thing paid for itself in saved feed by week two. If you don‚Äôt grab this exact one, at least make sure you get something with a roost cone and adjustable legs. Trust me on that.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôve been thinking about getting chickens juststop thinking and start building. The perfect time never comes, we were not prepared and things were/are not yet perfect, but hear me out: Chickens are quiet, low-maintenance, and one of the most cost-effective ways to boost your food security. Just be ready to chase a few around the yard and clip some wings. It's worth it. Especially with the way things are going.</p>
