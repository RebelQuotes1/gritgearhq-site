<h1>🐔 The Chicken Shortage of 2025 Is Real — And I’m Raising My Own</h1>

<p>First it was toilet paper. Now it’s chickens. And I’m not exaggerating — prices are out of control. Some people are charging <strong>$35 per bird</strong> on Marketplace or Craigslist. My wife and I got lucky meeting a guy in the parking lot of Tractor Supply. We snagged 5 hens for <strong>$70 total</strong>, which feels like a heist compared to what others are paying.</p>

<p>We got a late start, so we ended up chasing birds around the yard like lunatics. Clipping wings, corralling them into the backyard, patching up gaps in our makeshift fence. We’ve only got a 5-foot fence, but after clipping, they don’t even try to escape. Truth is, they don’t want to leave — our backyard is a damn paradise.</p>

<p>I turned our shed into a temporary coop while I fix up the old one. We’ve got a compost pile, a wild patch for butterflies and dragonflies, a pond with a fountain, and plenty of shade. The chickens love it. They’ve got everything they need. And best of all, I’ve got eggs, pest control, and peace of mind.</p>

<h2>Why Everyone’s Grabbing Chickens Right Now</h2>
<p>People sense it — even if they can’t say it out loud. The world’s unstable. Food prices are stupid. Grocery stores feel like a gamble. So folks are grabbing chickens like it’s the new toilet paper. Self-reliance is cool again.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you’ve been thinking about getting chickens — stop thinking and start building. Chickens are quiet, low-maintenance, and one of the most cost-effective ways to boost your food security. Just be ready to chase a few around the yard and clip some wings. It's worth it. Especially with the way things are going.</p>
